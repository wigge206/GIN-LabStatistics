Lab statistic material for the Genetics Interest Lecture (GIN) lecture series.

The bio_stats.Rmd (rmarkdown file) contains R, CSS and HTML code used to generate the bio_stats.html file. 
The bio_stats.html will contain code chucks and R output which should be able to be replicated locally, assuming you have data files stored locally.
 
Dummy datasets are in Data or have been generated in R.
