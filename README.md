# GIN-LabStatistics
Lab statistic material for the Genetics Interest Network (GIN) tutorials.

## Downloading a version
The best way to utlisie the material is copy a version of repository locally. 

1) `git clone https://github.com/wigge206/GIN-LabStatistics` 
2) downloaded the zipped folder directly from https://github.com/wigge206/GIN-LabStatistics
	- The download zip option is part of the drop down menu when you click the code button

## R code	
Once local and folder decompressed open the lab_stats.html. There are serval pages you can navigate to see examples of how to use R to perform statistically analyses and generate plots/tables. 
For the 'raw' R code these are avaliable as R scripts in the R folder, additionally the Rmd files show the code used to generate the markdown documents and includes all the R code. 
	- Note there is a lot of other bits in these folder including some CSS and HTML code used to generate the html files.
	- Caution: The Rscripts are untested, if all packages are installed the only issues will be the paths.
